 ##Describe four (4) approaches of installation, explain how they are applied and choose any existing system at Mzumbe University and select    the best way of installation.<br/>
Installation, this is the among of the implementation phase of a system, to which is the process of changing from the current information system to the new one. It involves building files and databases, converting relevant data from one or more old system to the new system and training system users. It where the equipment, software, hardware or any other computer program is put into a correct position and made ready to use.
The project team or analyst can apply four approaches to move from the old system to the new developed system as follows;<br/>
Parallel installation 
This refers to the running of both old information system and the new one at the same time until the management or organization decides the old system to be turned off or terminated at the point that the new system is working sufficiently. This allows the problems with the new system to be found without loss of data.
The output from both system are compered and difference is reconciled. The advantage of this conversion is that it gives a high degree of protection to the organization from the failure in the new system and has gained a wide spread popularity.
The disadvantage will be the cost of associated with the duplicating facilities and personnel to maintain the de system. This conversion is opposite of direct conversion.<br/>
In parallel conversion a target data should set to indicate when this conversion can be withdrawn and the new system will operate on its own. If the different occur between the old and new system, it should be verified with the same input to make sure of the transaction.<br/>
Direct installation.<br/>
This refer to changing over from the old information system to the new one by turning off the old system when the new system is turned on. This conversion method is only used when it is not feasible to operate separate system at the same time. The design of the new system is complete different from that of the old system, that is the new system can either be small or simple as compered to the design of the old system.  Any data and training must be done before the installation.<br/>
Single location (pilot) installation.<br/>
This involves the installation of a new developed information system at one site and use the experience to decide if and how the new system should be deployed throughout the organization. For example a system can be installed at first at one sale region and if is proved successful, the same can be installed to another sale region and so on.<br/>
This approach may have some of the advantages including, the problem occurred in the system in the system can be rectified before further implementation of such system and other operating personnel can be trained before the implementation of their location.
Phased installation.<br/>
 This kind of installation it seem similar to the pilot installation (a system is installed at one part or site of an organization) but here the system itself is segmented. it involves changing from the old information system to the new one incrementally, starting with one or a few functional components and then gradually extending the installation to cover the whole new system. Often used when the product as a whole is still under development.<br/>
The advantage of this is that the rate of change in a given organization can be minimized and the data processing resources can be acquired gradually over an extended period of time. The disadvantage is that the costs are incurred to develop temporary interfaces with old systems.<br/>
Take an example of MU-ARMS at Mzumbe university, to make an installation of this system it better to use parallel installation approach to which all of the system operate at the same time despite of the costs associated with it. Due to  the fact that, the approach it gives high degree of protection to the organization from the failure of the new system. It avoid the loss of the important information of an organization.<br/>
